Property Rental Database System

In this project, I developed a comprehensive property rental database system aimed at streamlining property management processes. I began by designing relational tables for properties, owners, tenants, property managers, and rental groups to efficiently organize data within the system. Following this, I implemented key functionalities such as property management, ownership management, tenant management, property manager management, rental group management, and rent calculation.

For the user interface, I created a user-friendly web application using PHP to interact with the MySQL database. This application allows users to seamlessly view property information, manage rental groups, and calculate average monthly rent. By combining database design, system development, and web application programming, this project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in various aspects of software development, providing an effective solution for property management tasks.
